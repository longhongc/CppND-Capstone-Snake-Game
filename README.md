# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

I extended the basic mode in snake game, and I added an enemy bot snake(Green Snake) to compete with the player(Blue Snake). The enemy bot snake has a transparent body and uses A* algorithm to track the food.

## Additional Project Feature Structure
The EnemySnake class is inside the Snake.h and Snake.cpp, and it is an inheritance class from the original Snake class. Its uses most of the Snake class member function except for the control and planning function which was replaced by using the Path_Planner class. 

The Path Planner class is for implementing the A* algorithm for the path planning of the enemy bot.
